sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_log.c in PHP before 5.5.31, 5.6.x before 5.6.17, and 7.x before 7.0.2 misinterprets the semantics of the snprintf return value, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and buffer overflow) via a long string, as demonstrated by a long URI in a configuration with custom REQUEST_URI logging.
